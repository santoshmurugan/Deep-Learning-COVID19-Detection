# BIOMEDIN260-FinalProject

We present a new opportunity to diagnose COVID computationally from lung scans. We used a publicly available dataset on Kaggle which contains a set of manually annotated lung CT scans with and without COVID-19. We built our predictive models using three well-known convolutional neural network architectures - AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet - and a custom architecture. Subsequently, we ensembled the models together for additional predictive power. 

Ultimately, the AlexNet model produced the best results with an accuracy of 84.38\%, F1 score of 85.23\%, and an AUC-ROC of 90.54%. Compared to an existing model for COVID-19 classification, our model performed at a similar caliber to a model on the same dataset that achieved an accuracy of 83%, F1 of 85%, and AUC-ROC of 95%.
